# Piano
Responsive web design piano.
I used pseudo-selectors, positioning and media queries. 
I need to go over media queries more. I get why we use them. I'm not always sure about the dimensions. I'll need to read about this to become more competent. It was good to see targeting elements of the keyboard, which makes more sense since the objects are separate. Text is going to usually look fine--will use rem or the like--but pictures, tables, etc., will need adjusted to look better on smaller screens and will need to be specified.
